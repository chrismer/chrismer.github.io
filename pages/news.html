                        <p>Jeff Bezos went into space accompanied by three other people - Mark Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race, and Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old student. Ms Funk became the oldest person to venture
                            into space, and Oliver Daemen the youngest.</p>
                        <p>The capsule they were in has the biggest windows flown in space. This meant the four passengers had stunning views of the Earth.</p>

                        <h3>Covid: Is the EU opening up?</h3>
                        <p>EU ambassadors have supported proposals to reopen borders for non-essential travel from countries with low infection rates of Covid-19. A list of countries from which travel will be permitted is to be agreed this week.</p>
                        <p>Diplomats in Brussels have said that visitors should be allowed to enter the EU from countries with low infection rates. This would apply to countries with an incidence rate of below 75 cases per 100,000 people.</p>

                        <p>The use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been paused in some European countries.</p>
                        <p>Oxford-AstraZeneca is a brand of vaccine that is being used to help prevent people catching coronavirus. But its use has been paused in several European countries following reports of blood clots in a small number of people who
                            have recently been given the jab.</p>
